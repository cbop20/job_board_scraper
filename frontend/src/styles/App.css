  /* 
  Primary Blue (#3498db): This can be used for the website's primary buttons, links, and important call-to-action elements. It's a vibrant color that attracts attention.

Dark Blue (#2c3e50): Use this for the website's background or as a secondary color for elements that need to stand out but aren't as critical as the primary blue elements.

Light Blue (#7f8c8d): This can be used for hover effects, subtle accents, or as a background color for certain sections to add variety without being too overpowering.

Steel Grey (#bdc3c7): Consider using this for the main background of the website, providing a neutral and professional look. It can also be used for borders or dividing sections.

Charcoal Grey (#34495e): Use this for text and other content to ensure good readability. It can also be used for navigation bars or other structural elements.

Off White (#ecf0f1): This can be used for backgrounds, especially if you want to create a clean and modern look. It also works well for text on dark backgrounds.*/
