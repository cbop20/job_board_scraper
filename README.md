This is a personal job baord scraping project.
Currently it is scraping Builtin Indeed and Ycomb, more may be added later. 
I understand that job boards don't generally like to be scraped as their only value are the job listing themselves, however this is meant to be more of an academic project than anything and will only ever be running locally.
